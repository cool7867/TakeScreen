# TakeScreen
TakeScreen is a screenshot taking application particularly optimized for software/content developers
When launch it sliently sits in the taskbar and attaches itself to PrtSc key. Whenever a screenshot is needed to be taken pressing PrtSc invokes the area selection to select and crop area to be captured. Selected area can then ne annoted, highlighted with different tools including:
- Pen
- Highliter
- Square
- Circle
- Line
- Arrow Line
- Text (Not yet implemented)

Tool fully supports undo and all the drawing is anti-alised. Also TakeScreen is optimized for multiscreens including 4k resolution and the memory footprint is neglegible.

Feature updates will include:
- Uploading screenshots to local/remote server
- Provide screenshot details
- Quickly send screenshot to a person on local LAN via inbuit chat system
- Directly email or upload screenshot to facebook and twitter
- Apart from screenshot, create short movies and gifs

I have tried to keep the code tidy and commented. Please fell free to devise and contribute more better approach for better CPU/Memory performance and features.
